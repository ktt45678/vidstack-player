The headless option is best when you want completely unstyled components. This particularly handy
when working with [Tailwind](docs/player/core-concepts/tailwind) as you can copy/paste examples from
our docs and adjust as desired. Do note that components will still be fully-accessible and
perform their expected function (e.g., the play button will toggle media playback) - they'll
just be unstyled.
