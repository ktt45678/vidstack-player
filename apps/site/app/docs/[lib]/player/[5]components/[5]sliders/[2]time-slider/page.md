ðŸ“– The [`$tag:media-slider`](/docs/player/components/sliders/slider) guide contains background
documentation that can be used when working with the time slider component.
{% /callout %}

## Usage

The `$tag:media-time-slider` component receives time updates from the provider through the media store,
and actively dispatches a `media-seeking-request` event (throttled to once per `100ms`) as the
slider value changes.

Seeking requests let the player know that the user is actively seeking but they haven't
determined the final playback position they want to seek to. When the user stops dragging the
slider, a `media-seek-request` event will be fired to request updating the current playback time
to the slider's value.

The time slider's range is represented as a percentage `0%` (min) and `100%` (max). Internally
percentages are used to calculate time positions where `100%` is equal to the length of the
media (i.e., duration).

{% code_preview name="usage" copyHighlight=true highlight="html:3|react:7" /%}

## Preview

The `preview` slot enables passing in any element to be displayed above the slider thumb
when being interacted with:

{% code_preview name="preview" size="small" copyHighlight=true highlight="html:2|react:7" /%}

### Grouping

Previews can be grouped by using a parent container element for the `preview` slot:

{% code_preview name="preview-group" copyHighlight=true highlight="html:3-6|react:12-15" /%}

## Chapters

Chapters are set by providing a [WebVTT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API)
file that specifies the time ranges and respective chapter titles. It should look something like
this:

```js
WEBVTT

00:00:00 --> 00:01:13
The Forest

00:01:13 --> 00:02:31
Camp Site

...
```

The time slider supports showing the current chapters text track that has a `mode` of showing:

{% code_preview name="chapters" copyHighlight=true highlight="html:3|react:3" /%}

### Title

The `chapter-title` part attribute can be added to any element inside the time slider. When
found, the current chapter title that is active or being previewed will be inserted inside of it:

{% code_snippet name="chapter-title" copyHighlight=true highlight="4" /%}

## Keyboard

The time slider will receive keyboard input when focused. The [interaction keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/slider_role#keyboard_interactions) are based on
standard accessibility guidelines.

The `$attr:key-step` and `$attr:shift-key-multiplier` can be used to configure how much to seek
backward/forward by on key press like so:

{% code_snippet name="keyboard" copy=true /%}

In the snippet above, each keyboard step (e.g., pressing left or right arrow key) will
respectively seek backward/forward by 5 seconds. Holding `shift` will multiply by the
step by 2, so a change of 10 seconds.

ðŸ‘‰ You can [configure global seek keys](/docs/player/core-concepts/keyboard#configuring-shortcuts)
on the player.

## Styling

You can override the default styles with CSS like so:

```css {% copy=true %}
media-time-slider {
}

/* Apply styles when device pointer is within slider bounds. */
media-time-slider[data-pointing] {
}

/* Apply styles when slider thumb is being dragged. */
media-time-slider[data-dragging] {
}

/* Shorthand for both dragging and pointing. */
media-time-slider[data-interactive] {
}

/* Apply styles when at live edge. */
media-player[data-live-edge] media-time-slider {
}

/** Apply styles to preview. */
media-time-slider [slot='preview'] {
}
```

### Parts

```css {% copy=true %}
/* Apply styles to all tracks. */
media-time-slider [part~='track'] {
}

/* Apply styles to track when interactive. */
media-time-slider[data-interactive] [part~='track'] {
}

/* Apply styles to track fill (played portion of slider). */
media-time-slider [part~='track-fill'] {
}

/* Apply styles to track fill when at live edge. */
media-player[data-live-edge] media-time-slider [part~='track-fill'] {
}

/* Apply styles to track progress (buffered). */
media-time-slider [part~='track-progress'] {
}

/* Apply styles to thumb container. */
media-time-slider [part='thumb-container'] {
}

/* Apply styles to slider thumb. */
media-time-slider [part='thumb'] {
}
```

### Focus

```css {% copy=true %}
media-time-slider {
  /* box shadow */
  --media-focus-ring: 0 0 0 4px rgb(78 156 246);
}

/* Apply styles to slider when focused via keyboard. */
media-time-slider[data-focus] {
}

/* Apply styles to slider track when focused via keyboard. */
media-time-slider[data-focus] [part='track'] {
}
```

### Chapters

```css
/* Apply styles to slider when chapters are available. */
media-time-slider[data-chapters] {
}

media-time-slider [part='chapter-container'] {
  margin-right: 2px;
}

/* Apply styles to chapter when container is hovered. */
media-time-slider [part='chapter-container']:hover [part='chapter'] {
  transform: scaleY(1.75);
  transition: transform 0.1s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1);
}

media-time-slider [part='chapter'] {
}

media-time-slider [part='chapter-title'] {
}
```

### CSS Variables

See the [slider CSS variables](/docs/player/components/sliders/slider#css-variables)
